# v-kaio
All-In-One kplugin + manager for PSVita

# Usage
Just install the vpk and open the "VKAIO" app.
 - 0: Disabled, 1: Enabled

# Notes
- The kaio plugin replaces the following kplugins:
  - LOLIcon, reF00D, rePatch, ioPlus by dots-tb
  - NoAvls by SilicaAndPina
  - NoNpDrm by TheFlow
  - Gamecard-MicroSD by xyzz (with uma0 mod)
- I do not own/did not write any of the listed plugins. I just created a combo for fun.
